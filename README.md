  # Commands to Install OpenCV
  
  ```bash
  # Install HomeBrew:
  /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
  
  #Run below brew commands:
  brew install cmake
  brew install qt5
  brew install opencv
  ```

  Then test opencv with sample from 00-TestOpenCV-Installation.
